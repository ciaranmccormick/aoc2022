## Advent of Code Template

A template repo for attempting Advent of Code challenges.

This is inspired by [Anthony Sottile's](https://github.com/anthonywritescode/aoc2015) Advent of Code Repo.

This repo provides a template `day00` directory that can be copied for each day's problem.

It also contains a `aoc` module that has a small CLI for downloading inputs and submitting solutions.

The `aoc` module also contains some help functions for solving the problems.

To download inputs and submit solutions just make a copy of the `.env.template` and add your AoC session cookie.

```sh
cp .env.template .env
```
